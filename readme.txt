== Description ==
Download this plugin for sending conversion focused browser push notifications to your users. Using Convertifier, you can easily send the push notifications. Through our dashboard, you can select a specific set of users and accordingly send them push notifications.
By using this WordPress plugin, you can send the notifications as soon as you publish the post. If you are scheduling the post, the push notification will also get scheduled and will be sent to your users as soon as the post is published.  Also, if you do not want to send the notifications as soon as you publish, then you can create a campaign from Convertifier dashboard and send it at a different time of the day. After installing the WordPress plugin, you can also customize the title and body of the notification. The featured image of the post will be used as the icon of the push notification being sent.
